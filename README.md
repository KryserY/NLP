# Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
This is a demo project for common NLP tasks.

## Getting Started
This project aims to conduct classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including the implementation of algorithms such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec for word embeddings, sequence models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Bidirectional RNN (Bi-RNN), and various text processing tasks such as stemming and lemmatization. They also engaged in part-of-speech tagging (PoS), dependency parsing, and named entity recognition (NER) tasks.
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x version

Please open an issue if there is any problem.

**Clone the Project:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Pengwei-Yang/NMF.git
```
### Instructions

The mentioned projects are each presented in Jupyter files, and test cases are provided within their respective documents. Detailed procedures are annotated in the documents, and one can follow the outlined steps to operate through the processes.
